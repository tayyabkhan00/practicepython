What is sklearn? (Super Easy Explanation)
Imagine sklearn as a magic toolbox 🧰 for Machine Learning.
You tell it:
“Hey sklearn, use this algorithm on this data.”
And sklearn says:
“Okay! I trained the model. Want to predict something?”
That’s it.
You don’t code algorithms yourself — sklearn does everything.

Every single sklearn model follows this simple pattern:
1️⃣ Import the model
2️⃣ Create the model
3️⃣ Train (fit) the model
4️⃣ Predict using the model
