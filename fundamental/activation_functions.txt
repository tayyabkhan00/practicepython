🧠 TOPIC 2 — Activation Functions:

Activation functions decide whether a neuron should fire or not.
They add non-linearity so neural networks can learn complex patterns.
Without them → your neural network becomes just linear regression.

⭐ 1. Sigmoid:
Used for: Binary classification (Yes/No, True/False)
Range:
0 → 1
Idea:
Turns numbers into probabilities.
Formula:
output = 1 / (1 + e^(-x))
Visual meaning:
Large positive → close to 1
Large negative → close to 0

⭐ 2. ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)
Used in: Almost every modern neural network (CNNs especially)
Range:
0 → ∞
Formula:
ReLU(x) = max(0, x)
Idea:
If value < 0 → becomes 0
If value > 0 → stays same
Why used so much?
✔ Fast
✔ Prevents vanishing gradients
✔ Gives better performance

⭐ 3. Tanh (Hyperbolic Tangent)
Used in: RNNs, LSTMs
Range:
-1 → 1
Better than sigmoid because outputs are centered around 0.

⭐ 4. Softmax
Used for: Multiclass classification
Example: classify image into 10 classes.
What it does:
Turns numbers → probabilities that add to 1.
Example:
[2.1, 1.0, 0.1] → [0.70, 0.25, 0.05]

⭐ When to use which?
Task	                Activation
Binary classification	Sigmoid
Hidden layers	        ReLU
RNN/LSTM networks	    Tanh
Multiclass output	    Softmax
