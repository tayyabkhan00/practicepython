⭐ 1. What is a Neural Network?
A neural network is a machine that learns patterns from data.
You give it:
Input → data (images, numbers, text)
Output → predictions (cat/dog, price, sentiment)
Inside it has:
weights
biases
activation functions
These are adjusted during training until the network becomes smart.

⭐ 2. The Smallest Neural Network (Perceptron)
A perceptron does this:

input → multiply by weight → add bias → apply activation → output
Formula:
output = activation(weight * input + bias)
This is the heart of all deep learning.

⭐ 3. Structure of a Neural Network
It has 3 layers:
1️⃣ Input Layer
Receives data
(e.g., 784 pixels of an image)
2️⃣ Hidden Layer(s)
Does the learning
(multiple neurons)
3️⃣ Output Layer
Final prediction
(e.g., dog/cat)

⭐ 4. What are Weights?
Think of weights like importance.
Example:
If weight = 0.9 → input is very important
If weight = 0.01 → input is not important
The model “learns” by adjusting weights.

⭐ 5. What are Biases?
Biases help the model shift predictions.
If weights are the slope,
bias is like adding an offset.
output = weight * input + bias
Without bias → the network is weak.

⭐ 6. Forward Pass (How NN Makes Predictions)
When you give input to the network:
Multiply inputs by weights
Add bias
Apply activation
Pass result to next layer
Continue until final output
This is called forward propagation.

⭐ 7. What a Neural Network Actually Learns
It learns the best weights and biases so that predictions are correct.
Example:
Image of digit “5” → Network learns shapes & patterns.

⭐ 8. Where most beginners get confused
Neural networks are NOT magic.
They only do repeated steps:
Multiply → Add → Activate → Compare → Adjust weights → Repeat.
That's it.
Deep learning = LOTS of layers doing this.
